# Flatpak package for Xilinx Vivado Design Suite

Vivado Design Suite is a software suite designed by Xilinx for the design,
synthesis and analysis of HDL for its line of FPGAs and SoCs.

Vivado Design Suite includes many tools, like Vivado, Vitis, Vitis HLS and many
others.

This package provides a flatpak wrapper over an official installation. As the
Xilinx tools are not redistributable, this package does not contain any
Xilinx-licensed material, which is instead downloaded on-the-fly through the
official Xilinx installer.
